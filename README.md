# Personal Homepage

Welcome to the source code of my personal homepage. This repsoitory has been forked from [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

## Contents of the Homepage

- [Blog](#umang94.github.com)
- [About](#umang94.github.com/about)
- [Author](#author)
- [License](#license)

## How I set it up ? 

1. Fork [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)
2. Rename the forked repository as [username].github.com. In my case the username was "umang94".
3. Clone the repository on to a local machine, for local development
4. Install jekyll, (Pretty easy to install on a mac)
5. Edit the \_config.yml to put in your own name and other information
5. Read a little about " markdown " and edit the "about.md" and "README.md" files accoriding to your needs
6. Commit the changes and push the repository back on to github.
7. Give a couple of minutes to github if it is the first time you are setting all this up. Your homepage would be available at [username].github.com
